GCC Compiler phases:

Scan, Parse, translate: 	parse.c, lex.c 	// Performs initial parsing, tokenization, lexical analysis, and translations into trees for the optimizer.
Optimize: 					optimize.c  //Performs optimizations on tree structures.
Generate Code:				After Research and much looking I can't actually find where this happens.

It was interesting to see the opertators.def file, as it contains all of the operators used by C++
